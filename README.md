# Solutions of tasks from the LeetCode platform

## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

## [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

## [Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the **last** word in the string.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " fly me to the moon "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
- There will be at least one word in s.

## [Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x \*\* 0.5 in python.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

## [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= n <= 45
